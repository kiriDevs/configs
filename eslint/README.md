# `@kiridevs_configs/eslint`

This package contains my personal default `eslint` configuration.

**Note:** This package uses the new, Flat Config format (`eslint.config.js`).
This is only supported since ESLint version `v8.21.0`, and will not become the
default format before major version 9.

## Usage

Consult [`LICENSE.md`](./LICENSE.md) for license information.
