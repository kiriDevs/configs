# kiriDevs/configs

Hi there! This repo contains my personal default configurations for tooling in
my projects. Take a look around and feel free to use what you like!

## Usage

Some of these configs are published to appropriate registries (i.e. `npm`) for
easy and canonical usage in any other projects. For information regarding a
specific config, see its respective `README.md` file in its subdirectory.
